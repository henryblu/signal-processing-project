# Week 1 
Programme: Bachelor in Science <br/>
Language: english (Python) <br/>
<br/>
Hourse spent: 10 hours <br/>

This week, I mostly just learned about the couse and looked into what topic I wanted to choose. 
In the begining, I was thinking about doing somthing related to maze algorityhms or somthing like that. 
However after looking into the kinds of topics I could do a project in, I think doing an investigation into Signal processing algorithms would be personally really interesting. 
In the past, I have studied radio signals and propagation and I am personally quite interested in the topic. 
After picking my topic, I looked into the different types of transformation algorithms and data sets I could use for the project.
I decided that I will start with learning about Fourier transformations and then if I have times, start looking into Hilbert transfomations.
During my reading I also read about how ML can be used for signal processing. However I have no Idea how that is done nor how I would do that. 
If I have time, I would definitly like to look into that. 
The rest of my time was spent looking into how this couse works. This was a bit more confusing then I hoped it would be. 
At this point, I think I understad everything, however the couse instrucitons are in finnish so I'm not sure if I'm missing anything.

Next week I will start to builld out my repository and do more reaserch into my algotihms. Hopefully I will also have enough knowledge to start coding.
