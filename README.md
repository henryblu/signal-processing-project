# signal-processing-project
This repository houses the code for my Data structures and Algorithms Lab project.    

## Project specification

Programme: **Bachelor in Science** <br/>
Language of the project: **English** <br/>
Coding language: **Python** <br/>

<br/>

### Problem

In this couse I will do an invesitgation into signal processing algorithms. I will start by trying to implement a Forier transformation on a sound wave using the baisc forier transformation, then I will look into fast forier transformations and finally Hilbert Transformations. <br/>

<br/>

##3 Data structures and algorithms

Signal Processing:
- Forier transfom 
- Fast forier transform
- Hilbert transform <br/>

For the signal I will be using in this project, I will use a basic unfiltered sound wave from a python library <br/>

To processes this sound wave, I will use firstly a regular fourier transformation which is really space and time inefficient. 
Then implement a fast fourier transformaiton algorithm which has a much faster time complexity.
Finally I will implement a hilbert's transformaiton algotihm.<br/>
Each of these three algorithms will be visulaied using pychart and posibly some sort of animation to demonstrate time complexity. 

<br/>

### Input

the imput will be a randomised sound wave which will be stored in a matrix of time/power pairs. 
<br/>

### Time complexity

Forier transformations require O(n^2) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. Here, n is the numebr of data points in the sound wave. <br/>
Fast Forier transformations require a O(n^2)to O(n*log(n)) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. Once again here, n is the numebr of data points in the sound wave. <br/>
Hilbert tramsformation inheris the regular forier transformation time and space complexity of O(n^2) and O(n). <br/>
