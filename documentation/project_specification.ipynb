    "\n",
    "In this course, I investigate signal processing algorithms. As an outcome of this project, I want to learn how to implement noise filtering using Fourier transforms on a radio wave. I will start by investigating the basic Fourier transform algorithm and trying to implement one myself. Then  I will implement and compare the basic algorithm to the fast Fourier transform algorithm. Both algorithms will output a frequency-time graph using some visual representation and Matplotlib to demonstrate the difference.\n",

    "For the signal I will be using in this project, I will use a basic unfiltered radio wave from a python library\n",
    "To processes this radio wave, I will use firstly a regular fourier transformation which is really space and time inefficient. \n",
    "Then implement a fast fourier transformaiton algorithm which has a much faster time complexity.\n",
    "Finally I will implement a hilbert's transformaiton algotihm.\n",
    "Each of these three algorithms will be visulaied using pychart and posibly some sort of animation to demonstrate time complexity. \n",
